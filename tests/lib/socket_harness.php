/**
 * Generic per-connection Unix socket harness, used by tests to stand in
 * for systemd's Accept=yes socket activation (StandardInput=socket /
 * StandardOutput=socket in sessioneer-agent@.service) without needing systemd.
 *
 * Usage: php socket_harness.php <socket-path> <command...>
 *
 * Listens on <socket-path>; for every connection, runs <command...> with
 * the accepted stream bound directly to its stdin *and* stdout (proc_open
 * accepts an existing stream resource as a descriptor and dup()s it into
 * the child), then goes back to accepting. Runs until the parent test
 * kills this process (proc_terminate) once its assertions are done.

/**
 * Kills whatever process currently has $socketPath open (almost always a
 * previous, now-orphaned instance of this same script) before this
 * instance unlinks and rebinds it. Found live 2026-08-08: unlinking the
 * socket FILE (the one cleanup step that already existed, both here and in
 * start_harness()) only removes the directory entry - it does nothing to
 * the PROCESS still holding the old listening socket open, which just
 * keeps running, orphaned, forever (10 of them had piled up across
 * several days of ad-hoc manual-verification runs reusing the same fixed
 * socket path - harmless individually, but pure accumulating clutter, and
 * it got in the way once already: cluttering a `ps aux | grep claude` scan
 * during an unrelated live-incident investigation the same night).
 *
 * Deliberately the FIRST thing this script does, before the real unlink/
 * bind/accept-loop below - a safeguard against leaked processes has to run
 * before anything that could itself fail or throw, or it's not a
 * safeguard. Best-effort by design (a stale process that's already gone,
 * or a socket path with nothing on it yet, are both just no-ops here) -
 * this must never be the reason a legitimate harness start fails.
