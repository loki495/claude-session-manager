/**
 * Cross-language parity check for App\Views\MarkdownRenderer::render_html()
 * (PHP) against its documented JS mirror, session.js's renderMarkdown() -
 * see MarkdownRenderer.php's own docblock ("Mirrored line-for-line...keep
 * both in sync") and test_markdown.php's own docblock, which candidly says
 * this exact gap existed: "verified byte-for-byte identical against every
 * case below during development (not re-checked here since there's no JS
 * test runner in this suite)". Found via the 2026-08-23 readability audit
 * as a real risk - nothing previously caught a future PHP-side change
 * (e.g. adding blockquote support) shipping with no matching JS update.
 *
 * Reuses test_markdown.php's own curated input strings (not reinvented
 * here) so both files stay aligned on what "the feature set" means.
 *
 * renderMarkdown() and its mdXxx() helpers live in their own file,
 * public/js/markdown.js (extracted out of session.js's page-scope IIFE
 * 2026-08-24, specifically because they're pure and have no DOM/session
 * dependencies - see that file's own header comment), as plain top-level
 * functions, same convention as common.js. This loads that file's real
 * shipped source verbatim (plus escapeHtml() from common.js, extracted by
 * marker since that file is not just this one function) and evals it
 * standalone in a blank page via CDP - still the REAL shipped code, just
 * run in isolation rather than via a full page load.
 *
 * Best-effort like test_session_replay_browser.php/test_ui_smoke.php's own
 * headless-Chrome tier: SKIPs (exit 0) rather than failing the suite if no
 * usable Chrome is on this host. *_browser.php filename so tests/run.sh's
 * --no-browser/--browser filtering picks it up automatically.
