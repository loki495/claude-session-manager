 * bucketKey (session/week_all/week_<plan>) => last-known pct/resets_at plus
 * whether a near/over/reset notification has already fired for the CURRENT
 * window - lets PushDeliveryService::check_and_send_quota_pushes() notify
 * once per crossing rather than on every tick, and re-arm each flag once
 * its window actually rolls over (resets_at passing, for reset; a real
 * rollover or a plan change, for near/over) rather than staying
 * permanently silenced from one earlier crossing. Lives in the
 * `push_quota_state` table of Config::push_sqlite_path() (see
 * PushSubscriptionStore's own docblock for the 2026-08-24 migration off a
 * plain JSON file, and its later removal of the lazy legacy-file importer
 * - this fixes the exact double-notification bug Andres reported, via a
 * single atomic write instead of a read-modify-write that a concurrent
 * tick could race).
 *
 * Deliberately its own table, separate from GlobalStateStore's
 * `quota_live_state` key (QuotaService::quota_from_statusline_state()'s
 * own source, written by host-agent/quota_live_state_write.php on every
 * statusLine render) - different write frequency and shape (one row per
 * bucket here, with its own notified-flag columns, vs. one flat JSON blob
 * there), not worth merging into one table just because both are
 * quota-flavored.
