 * The fixed 7-row vocabulary behind Antigravity's real `/model` picker, in

 * disposable scratch `agy` sessions (never the real tracked session), same
 * "confirm against the real thing" discipline SelectableModel.php's own
 * Claude Code vocabulary already used.
 *
 * UNLIKE Claude Code's own picker (see SelectableModel.php), Antigravity's
 * has no session-only confirm key - there is only one "enter Select"
 * action, and it always overwrites the ACCOUNT-WIDE default model, applying
 * to every future `agy` session including ones started by hand outside this
 * app. Confirmed live: switching the model inside one throwaway session,
 * then killing it and starting a brand new unrelated one, showed the new
 * session picked up the switched model rather than resetting - so
 * PromptInteractionService::set_antigravity_model() below is knowingly a
 * global-default switch, not a per-session one (Andres's own explicit
 * decision 2026-08-24 after being shown this finding, not an oversight).
