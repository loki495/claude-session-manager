/**
 * Registered as Claude Code's PreToolUse hook (see HookService::install_session_hook()
 * in ../lib/Sessions.php, and the README) - fires right before every tool
 * call, whether or not it ends up needing user approval, and before any
 * approval prompt is shown. Its main job is to record the full,
 * untruncated tool_name/tool_input JSON to a per-session sidecar file
 * (see PendingToolStore::write_pending_tool()), so build_session_entry() can show a pending
 * permission prompt's real full command/file content instead of whatever
 * tmux's rendered pane happens to have room to display (see
 * BLOCKING_PROMPT_CONTEXT_WINDOW / TMUX_PANE_WIDTH/HEIGHT for the
 * pane-scraping fallback this complements, not replaces).
 *
 * ALSO clears SessionStatusStore's blocked state (found live 2026-08-22: a
 * session stuck showing a stale "waiting on input" prompt on the dashboard
 * and session page long after it was actually resolved) - permission_
 * request.php sets status=blocked for a tool that needs a decision, but
 * once approved, nothing else in this app's hook sequence ever clears it
 * unless the SAME turn also happens to fire UserPromptSubmit or Stop.
 * Claude Code processes tool calls one at a time even within one batched
 * turn, so a later tool call's own PreToolUse firing is itself proof any
 * earlier blocking has already been resolved - Claude Code would never
 * start executing tool call N+1 while tool call N's permission prompt is
 * still genuinely unanswered. If THIS tool call also needs a decision,
 * permission_request.php fires right after and sets status=blocked again,
 * so the net effect is correct either way, just briefly optimistic between
 * the two hook firings (invisible to a poll-based UI) - EXCEPT for
 * AskUserQuestion (see below), which never gets that second firing.
 *
 * AskUserQuestion special case (found live 2026-08-23: a session stuck
 * showing "Thinking..." on the dashboard/session page while its pane was
 * actually sitting on a real, answerable question): PermissionRequest is
 * Claude Code's own hook for permission decisions specifically - per the
 * official tools reference, AskUserQuestion prompts are a distinct
 * mechanism from permission prompts (they even have their own separate
 * idle-timeout setting), and confirmed live it never fires PermissionRequest
 * at all. Left to the general logic above, status would sit at "working"
 * forever - nothing else in the hook sequence would ever flip it to
 * "blocked". So for this one tool, this hook writes "blocked" directly
 * instead, using the same tool_name/tool_input shape permission_request.php
 * writes for everything else (just no permission_suggestions, since
 * AskUserQuestion never has any).
 *
 * Deliberately writes nothing to stdout and always exits 0 - Claude Code
 * treats that as "no opinion", leaving its own permission decision
 * completely untouched. This hook only ever observes.
 *
 * CSM_SESSION_NAME (set via `tmux new-session -e` in create_cc_session())
 * is how this app's own tmux-spawned sessions are told apart from any
 * other claude process on the box - inherited by this hook script as a
 * child process of that same pane's claude. Anything without it (a plain
 * claude session Andres started by hand) is a deliberate no-op.
