/**
 * Registered as Claude Code's Stop hook (see HookService::
 * install_session_hook() in ../lib/Sessions.php, and the README) - fires
 * once Claude finishes responding (not while blocked on a permission
 * prompt, which stays "in progress" from Claude Code's own perspective
 * until answered). Marks the session idle and clears any blocked state -
 * the third leg of the working/blocked/idle inference described in
 * user_prompt_submit.php's own docblock.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT try to use Stop firing as a transcript-freshness
 * signal (ruled out 2026-08-02, see the todo file - Claude Code writes the
 * transcript file ~1.7-2s BEFORE Stop fires) - this hook only ever updates
 * the status file, nothing transcript-related. That same "transcript
 * already written by the time Stop fires" timing IS relied on for one
 * thing here: clearing SessionStatusStore's `model` optimistic override
 * (see its own docblock) - the turn that just finished already used
 * whatever model was picked, so the transcript's own current_model is
 * trustworthy again and the override would only risk going stale from here.
 *
 * Writes nothing to stdout and always exits 0 - same "no opinion"
 * convention as every other hook this app installs.
 *
 * CSM_SESSION_NAME gate: same as the other hooks - a plain claude session
 * started by hand is a deliberate no-op.
